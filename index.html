        <h2>Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior</h2>
        <h4>Paris Saint Germain - Brazil</h4>
        <p>Fast, tricky, clever and skilful – Neymar is particular dangerous one on one, but he can shine in any attacking position, capable of showing his quality on the counter or finding spaces in a packed defence with his stunning turn of pace. Neymar is a lethal weapon against any defence.The Brazilian national team's number 10 is also capable of working hard for the team by pressing opponents and helping out with defensive duties and his great shooting from distance has helped him score some spectacular goals in his career so far  - particularly from free kicks which have become a speciality.</p>
